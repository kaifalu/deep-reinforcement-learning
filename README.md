System Planning and Operational Optimization & Automation for Shared Micromobility System Design - Plan-Making Automation
## Research Design: 
This research aims to optimize and automate the design and operation of shared micromobility systems by leveraging big data, geospatial analysis, and reinforcement learning to improve urban mobility. System design involves selecting docked or parking sites and managing fleet size and distribution. To achieve this, this study developed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that fully optimized and automated the plan-making process of system design. In this chapter, this approach targeted multiple goals: increasing usage, ensuring equitable access, promoting cost-effectiveness, and improving integration with public transit. To evaluate this approach, we applied the framework in a case study of Gainesville, Florida, using synthetic scooter trip data to simulate system operations. The performance of the DRL-generated system plan was benchmarked against existing planning configurations to assess its effectiveness and potential for real-world application, guiding improvements in system design and operation aligned with designated goals. The research design is illustrated in Figure below.

## Key Findings: 
Transitioning from micromobility planning and operation to strategic system design, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework was developed to automate shared micromobility system design under different scenarios. A case study in Gainesville using synthetic scooter data demonstrated that DRL-generated plans could increase scooter usage, reduce fleet size and capital costs, expand service coverage, and enhance modal integration with public transit systems. The multi-agent DRL approach enables flexible prioritization of different planning goals (e.g., usage, equity, cost-effectiveness, and multimodal integration) and allows for the adjustment of key assumptions (e.g., the extent of rebalancing operations and permitted device usage frequency). This flexibility provides customizable and actionable guidance for decision-makers and transport planners to optimize micromobility system design. The results derived from this AI-automated transport planning framework highlight AIâ€™s potential to automate and optimize micromobility planning, reduce reliance on manual design, and enable more efficient, accessible, and multimodal urban transportation systems.
